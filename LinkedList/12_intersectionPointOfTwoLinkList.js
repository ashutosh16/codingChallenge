/**
 * Write a function to get the intersection point of two link list.
 * Method 1.
 *  - count length of both linked list c1 and c2.
 *  - diff = abs(c1-c2) 
 *  - Travel long linked list for diff steps. So that here onwords both linked list have same nodes. 
 *  - Travel both list in parallel till come to the common node.
